`meta-ros-webos` is the OpenEmbedded layer for interfacing between `meta-ros`
and webOS OSE.

As of Milestone 15 (2020-12-23), this branch can be used to add the releases
current at the beginning of November 2020 of ROS 2 **dashing**, **eloquent**,
**foxy**, and **rolling** and ROS 1 **melodic** to webOS OSE 2.8 (which is built
with the **dunfell** OpenEmbedded release series).

Instructions for using `meta-ros` with `meta-ros-webos` are
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions).
