`meta-ros-webos` is the OpenEmbedded layer for interfacing between `meta-ros`
and webOS OSE.

As of Milestone 16 (2021-06-24), this branch can be used to add the releases
current at the end of June 2021 of ROS 2 **dashing**, **eloquent**, **foxy**,
**galactic**, and **rolling** and ROS 1 **melodic** and **noetic**to webOS OSE
2.10 (which is built with the **dunfell** OpenEmbedded release series).

Instructions for using `meta-ros` with `meta-ros-webos` are
